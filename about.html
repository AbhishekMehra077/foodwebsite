						<div id="midblock2">
						
						
						<h3>FOODHUB was refounded in 2025 by ABHISHEK MEHRA, former employees of Yahoo! . After leaving Yahoo! in September 2025, they took some time off in South America.<br> At one point, they applied for jobs at Facebook but were rejected.

In January 2025, after purchasing an LAPTOP and realizing the potential of the website industry on the internet, ABHISHEK began visiting Koum's friend Alex in West San Jose to discuss a new type of food website that would "[show] statuses next to individual names  of the food items  easily". They realized that to take the idea further, they'd need an best web developer.ABHISHEK visited securenet, web developer NIRAJ Punta, and introduced him to Koum.

Koum named the website to sound like "FOODHUB". On june, 2025, he incorporated food hub Inc. in California. However, when early versions of food kept crashing, Koum considered giving up and looking for a new job.<br> Acton encouraged him to wait for a "few more months".

In June 2025, pizzahut launched new website, allowing users to be pinged when they were not using an website.<br> Koum changed foodhub so that when a user's status is changed, everyone in the user's network would be notified.[<br> FOODHUB was released with a messaging component and the number of active users suddenly increased to 250,000. Although Acton was managing another startup, he decided to join the company.In October 2025, Acton persuaded five former friends at Yahoo! to invest $250,000 in seed funding, and Acton became a co-founder and was given a stake. He officially joined foodhub on November 1. After months at beta stage, the website launched in Nov 2025 exclusively on the web. Koum then hired a friend in Los Angeles, Chris Peiffer, to develop a app, which arrived two months later.

To cover the primary cost of sending verification texts to users, foodhub was changed from a free service to a paid one. In December 2023, the ability to easily order food .<br> By early 2025 foodhub was one of the top 20 apps at Apple's U.S. App Store.

In April 2026, Sequoia Capital invested about $8 million for more than 15% of the company, after months of negotiation with Sequoia partner Jim Goetz.<br>

By February 2026, FOOD HUB had about 200 million active users and 50 staff members. Sequoia invested another $50 million, and FOODhub was valued at $1.5 billion.

In a December 2026 blog post, FOODHUB claimed that 400 million active users used the service each month.</h3>
